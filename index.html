			<h3>Hurt</h3>
			<p>
				Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face<br>
				You told me how proud you were but I walked away
				<br>
				If only I knew what I know today Ooh, ooh<br>
        	</p> 
        	<p>
	        	I would hold you in my arms<br>
				I would take the pain aaa aaa aaa<br>
				Thank you for all you've done<br>
				Forgive all your mistakes<br>
				There's nothing I wouldn't do<br>
				To hear your voice again<br>
				Sometimes I wanna call you<br>
				But I know you won't be there<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Oh I'm sorry for blaming you<br>
				For everything I just couldn't do<br>
				And I've hurt myself by hurting you<br>
